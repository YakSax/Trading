// This indicator attempts to proxy buy and sell volume based on candle open, high, low, and close. It is not the true buy volume.
// Note: The Sell volume is actually Total Volume so that it is visible above the buy volume.

// BUYING VOLUME AND SELLING VOLUME //
buyVolume = high == low ? 0 : volume * (close - low) / (high - low)
sellVolume = high == low ? 0 : volume * (high - close) / (high - low)

plot(volume, style = plot.style_columns, color = color.red, title = 'SELL V') // shows total volume
